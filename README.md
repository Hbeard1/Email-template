 Responsive Email for Cohen

This is a responsive email template that I created using HTML and CSS. The whole layout is made using nested tables. 

The challenging part of this project was trying to keep the code readable due to the nature of nested tables and having to keep track of each element. I used comments and gave a unique class name to help keep the code clean. I also used MailChimp to convert my CSS into inline CSS. I was also able to link the address to google maps, linked the phone number to make a call when clicked, and linked all the social media links. The most difficult part of this was not being able to use the full capability of HTML because of the lack of support in certain email clients or devices.
